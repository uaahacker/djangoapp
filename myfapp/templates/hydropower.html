        <h2>The Power of Flowing Water</h2>
        <p>Hydropower, also known as hydroelectric power, is a sustainable energy source generated by harnessing the energy from the flow of water, typically in rivers and dams. The force of moving water is used to turn turbines, which, in turn, generates electricity. It is one of the oldest and most widely used forms of renewable energy.</p>
        <p>Key features of hydropower include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Renewable and clean: Hydropower is a sustainable source of energy that produces minimal greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
            <li>Reliable and efficient: It provides consistent energy generation and can be used for baseload or peak-load power generation.</li>
            <li>Water resource management: Hydropower projects often involve managing water resources for multiple purposes, including irrigation and flood control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hydropower plays a vital role in providing clean energy and supporting environmental sustainability.</p>
